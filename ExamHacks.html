      <h1>Exam Hacks</h1>
      <p>
        Here we provide general hacks for exams (not for learning, of course one learns also here and there once one prepares for exam, but on should be aware of the fact that the main goal is to ace the exam not to learn! cf. our remark <a href="academiaclandestina.com/Remarks">Learning for an exam vs. Learning to understand</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        One should be aware that an exams (regardless of subject) rarely tells whether you are smart or dumb. It only tells you whether you prepared correctly or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the recommendations below should be done early in the semester, so that if you follow lectures, you already know what to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to guess what will be the exam questions based on the topics the professor discusses and likes. (Paul Graham Method)</li>
          <li>Always start with the old exams. You start with these before the semester so that you know what is important and hat not. (e.g. is the professor asking questions from guest lectures?). But be careful, always learn only from the past exams of the professor that will teach the course when you take it. Exams from other professors can be used for practice once you have nothing better to do in your life. </li>
          <li>Always learn with <b>correct</b> solutions. </li>
          <li>Make sure you know the format of an exam? is it closed- or open-book. How long is it? is it on a computer or on a paper? Is it take home exam or in person exam? All these things will help you 1) guess what can be asked and 2) how to prepare. How many questions are there? How many points per question is there? Is it multiple choice and if yes do you get points subtracted when answered wrongly, is it possible to have several choices correct, what happens if I select only one correct answer but say two are correct, do I get still partial points or not?  <br> For example, if the exam is op</li>
          <li>Develop a strategy to complete the exam based on the form of the exam. <br> For example if the exam is has several parts you will go to the exam already knowing which part you will do first, second and so on, so that you work most efficiently and collect as many points as possible.</li>
