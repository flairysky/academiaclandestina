      <h1>Study Hacks</h1>
      <p>
        Here you can find generic strategies and techniques to learn. In our experience, some of them are very well known, but some are somehow not.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Confidence-Boosters (inspired by Steph Curry)</b>
            <br>When you start learning, and you know you have a difficult topic ahead of you, you can start by repeating for 5min stuff from previous study session you already know that is a prerequisite for what you are going to learn, so that you warm up, get into the zone and gain confidence, before your start with the difficult topics.</li>
          <li><b>Pomodoro Method</b>
             <br>it can be useful to set up timer, so that you learn say 45min and make 15 min break, however the precise timing is very individual and need to be figured out on the go, also this method is probably not for everybody.</li>
          <li><b>Chatgpt</b>
            <br>Use Chatgpt where you can, for example, dictate instead of write on keyboard or paper, you will be faster.
          <br>Also, it is worthwhile to consult alternatives like Grok etc.</li>
          <li><b>Old exams</b>
            <br>You <b>always</b> start with old exams when preparing for an exam.
            <br>You will find as many old exams for this specific subject written by <b>the professor</b> who will write your exam.
            <br>And you will go through the topics he asked about first. After you master those topics and the old exams, you can have a look at the remaining stuff.
